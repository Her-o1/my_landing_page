The maps display the specific location selected from the graph as well as a weather icon of the current weather and a popup of what the temperature looks like at the time of selection.

At the moment the maps only display the exact geographic location on a custom made Mapbox tilelayer. 
Future improvements will have the maps display the temperature/wind variations colorfully per location.
